title: Increasing heat and precip. extremes.

Three methods for examining climatic extremes over the historical period were updated to include data from the last decade (2011-2020). The analysis shows that, particularly in the tropics, the mean climate has shifted by four standard deviations away from the historical average - a level of warming that would be essentially impossible to access without anthropogenic climate change. Meanwhile monthly temperature records are being broken consistent with a simple statistical model that attributes the excess records to global warming. In addition, 1-in-4 rainfall records in the last decade can be attributed to climate change. As temperatures continue to increase, these unprecedented changes will expand into higher latitude regions too.
