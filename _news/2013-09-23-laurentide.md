title: Oceanic forcing of the Laurentide ice sheet.

Here we show how external oceanic forcing is a plausible driver of the enigmatic millennial-scale variability of the Laurentide ice sheet during the last glacial periods. We find excellent agreement when comparing ice discharge frequency from the ice-sheet model with proxy data for ice-rafted debris deposition the North Atlantic.
