title: Performance of ice-dynamics solvers.
inline: false

Five ice-dynamics solvers were implemented in Yelmo and tested for numerical performance. The DIVA solver comes out as the clear winner, especially as resolution increases.

Analytical results combined with numerical simulations show that the Hybrid and L1L2-SIA solvers maintain a quadratic dependence of the maximum stable timestep with grid resolution, while the DIVA and SSA solvers can use much larger timesteps and remain stable.
