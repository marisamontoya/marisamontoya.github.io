<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1449" target="_blank">Robinson et al. (2012)</a> use the coupled climate--ice-sheet model REMBO-SICOPOLIS to simulate the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) under various levels of global warming. The ice sheet is found to lose stability above the warming threshold of 1.6°C, with faster rates of mass loss for higher temperatures. 

Here is an animation of melting of the GrIS under 6°C of global warming.
