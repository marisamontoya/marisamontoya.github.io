In this work, we assessed the effect of millennial-scale oceanic variability on the GrIS evolution from the last interglacial to the present day. We show that the GrIS evolution during the LGP could have been strongly influenced by oceanic changes on millennial timescales, leading to oceanically induced ice-volume contributions above 1 m sea level equivalent (SLE).
