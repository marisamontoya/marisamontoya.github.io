<h2>Yelmo ice-sheet model</h2>

Yelmo is a state-of-the-art, open-source 3D ice sheet model developed in the PalMA-ice research group at the UCM.

CLIMBER-X is a new <em>fast</em> Earth system model (FESM) under development at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. I have been working with Matteo Willeit and Andrey Ganopolski to build the model from the ground up, and to couple Yelmo with it.
