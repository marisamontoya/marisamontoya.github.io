I am a climate scientist and glaciologist with expertise in several areas. My primary research relates to long time-scale Earth system stability and large-scale feedbacks in the context of past glacial cycles and future climate change (e.g., [Robinson et al., Nat. Clim. Change, 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1449); [Robinson et al., Nat. Comm., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16008)). In addition, I am interested in the modeling and analysis of extreme and abrupt climate events (e.g., [Coumou and Robinson, Env. Res. Lett., 2013](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034018); [Caesar et al., Nat., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0006-5)), as well as the resilient design of hybrid renewable energy generation systems for changing climatic conditions (e.g., [Petrakopoulou et al., Re. Ener., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148116304414?via%3Dihub), [Petrakopoulou et al., J. Clean. Prod., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620328614?via%3Dihub)).
