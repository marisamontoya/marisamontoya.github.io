I am a climate scientist and glaciologist with expertise in several fields. My primary research relates to long time-scale Earth system stability and large-scale feedbacks in the context of past glacial cycles and future climate change (e.g., Robinson et al., Nat. Clim. Change, 2012; Robinson et al., Nat. Comm., 2017). In addition, I am interested in the modeling and analysis of extreme and abrupt climate events (e.g., Coumou and Robinson, Env. Res. Lett., 2013; Caesar et al., Nat., 2018), as well as the resilient design of hybrid renewable energy generation systems for changing climatic conditions (e.g., Petrakopoulou et al., Re. Ener., 2016, Petrakopoulou et al., J. Clean. Prod., 2020).
