I am a climate scientist and glaciologist with expertise in several areas. My primary research relates to long time-scale Earth system stability and large-scale feedbacks in the context of past glacial cycles and future climate change (e.g.,

<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16008" target="_blank">Robinson et al., Nat. Comm., 2017</a>). 
In addition, I am interested in the modeling and analysis of extreme and abrupt climate events (e.g.,

as well as the resilient design of hybrid renewable energy generation systems for changing climatic conditions (e.g.,
